    <div class="entry-content">A homework assignment for my storage class required running ~30 hours of benchmarks of the btrfs and ext4 filesystems. &nbsp;I thought this would be an excellent time to test Bosco's ability to submit to Amazon EC2 to parallelize the benchmarks.<br /><br /><h3>Preparing Submission</h3><div>In order to start instances on Amazon EC2, you first need to sign up. &nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>&nbsp;and sign up in the top right. &nbsp;After you sign up, you will need the access and secret key. &nbsp;These can be found in the 'Security Credentials' from the account drop down box. &nbsp;They are in the 'Access Keys' tab under the&nbsp;'Access Key ID' and&nbsp;'Secret Access Key'. &nbsp;Write those values in 2 files, you will need them when you submit EC2 instances.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0l_ddtj9fXc/URHJOTsFD8I/AAAAAAAAB2o/lAp3Yn_RVS8/s1600/amazoncred.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

You may connect to the EC2 instance with the command, replacing the XXXX with the job number, and hostname with the address you get from the above command:<br /><pre>$ ssh -i keyfile.XXXXX ec2-user@<span style="color: red;">hostname</span></pre><br /><h3>Summary</h3><div>Pros of using Bosco to submit Amazon EC2 Jobs:</div><div><ul><li>Simple management of Amazon instance <b>from your workstation</b>.</li><li>Specify spot price right inside of the job description.</li><li>Ability to bootstrap the instance easily with user data scripts.</li><li>Ability to use HTCondor policies in order to manage the instances, such as periodic remove statement above.</li></ul>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>The EC2 universe is only available on Linux builds of Bosco. &nbsp;You cannot manage EC2 instances on the Mac version of Bosco.</li><li>Amazon EC2 has hundreds and hundreds of features, Bosco only allows you to use the simple submit EC2 instances and spot pricing. &nbsp;You will not be able to use the vast majority when you are using Bosco to manage your instances. &nbsp;But if all you need is to run some processing, Bosco is great!</li></ul></div><br /></div><script src="https://raw.github.com/moski/gist-Blogger/master/public/gistLoader.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><center><a href="http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/">     <img src="https://raw.github.com/osg-bosco/bosco-download-images/master/images/download-orange.png"       alt="Bosco Download"      style="border-width: 0;" /> </a><br /><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US" rel="license"><img alt="Creative Commons License" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png" style="border-width: 0;" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>. </center></div>

      <p class="meta">
        <time datetime="2013-02-05T11:46:28Z" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 5<span>th</span>, 2013  &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Matthew Farrellee</time>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Configuration of accounting groups in HTCondor is too often an expert task that requires coordination between administrators and their tools.</p>
<p>Wallaby provides a coordination point, so long as a little convention is employed, and can provide a task specific interface to simplify configuration.</p>
<p>Quick background, <a href="http://getwallaby.com/">Wallaby</a> provides semantic configuration for HTCondor. It models a pool as parameters aggregated into features and nodes aggregated in groups, with features and individual parameters associated with nodes and groups. It provides semantic validation of configuration before it is distributed, and has expert knowledge for minimal impact configuration changes.</p>
<p>And, accounting group configuration in HTCondor is spread across seven fixed parameters (GROUP_NAMES, GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS, GROUP_SORT_EXPR, GROUP_NAMES, GROUP_QUOTA_ROUND_ROBIN_RATE, GROUP_AUTOREGROUP, GROUP_QUOTA_MAX_ALLOCATION_ROUNDS), and another five dynamic parameters (GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS_groupname, GROUP_AUTOREGROUP_groupname, GROUP_PRIO_FACTOR_groupname, GROUP_QUOTA_groupname, GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_groupname). These are dynamic because the &#8220;groupname&#8221; in the parameter is any name listed in the GROUP_NAMES parameter.</p>
<p>In addition to its other features, Wallaby has an <a href="http://getwallaby.com/2010/10/extending-the-wallaby-shell/">extensible shell mechanism</a>, which can be used to create task specific porcelain.</p>
<p>For instance, agree that tools and administrators will store accounting group configuration on a feature called AccountingGroups, and the tools can use Wallaby&#8217;s API to manipulate the configuration while the following porcelain can simplify the task for managing that configuration by administrators.</p>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago I discovered <a href="http://webnumbr.com">Web Numbr</a>, a service that will monitor a web page for a number and graph that number over time.</p>
<p>I installed a handful of webnumbrs to track things at <a href="http://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu">HTCondor&#8217;s gittrac instance</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://webnumbr.com/search?query=condor">http://webnumbr.com/search?query=condor</a></p>
<p>Thing such as -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webnumbr.com/condor-resolved-tickets-with-no-destination">Tickets resolved with no destination:</a> tickets that don&#8217;t indicate what version they were fixed in. Anyone wanting to know if a bug is fixed or feature was added to their version of HTCodnor and encounters one of these will have to go spelunking in the repository for their answer.</li>
<li><a href="http://webnumbr.com/condor-resolved-and-unassigned-tickets">Tickets resolved but not assigned:</a> tickets that were worked on, completed, but whomever worked on them never claimed ownership.</li>
<li><a href="http://webnumbr.com/condor-action-items-with-commits">Action items with commits:</a> tickets that are marked as Todo/Incident, yet have associated code changes. Once there is a code change the ticket is either a bug fix (ticket type: defect) or feature addition (ticket type: enhancement). Extra work is imposed on whomever comes after the ticket owner who wants to understand what they are looking at. Additionally, these tickets skew information about bugs and features in releases.</li>
<li><a href="http://webnumbr.com/condor-tickets-with-invalid-version-field">Tickets with invalid version fields:</a> tickets that do not follow the, somewhat strict, version field syntax &#8211; vXXYYZZ, e.g. v070901. All the extra 0s are necessary and the v must be lowercase.</li>

    <div class="entry-content">At the heart of the OSG Compute Element (CE) is the gatekeeper software. &nbsp;The gatekeeper software anchors three core pieces of functionality:<br /><ol><li><b>Remote access</b>: The gatekeeper provides a network service that remote clients can contact and interact with.</li><li><b>Authentication and authorization</b>: The gatekeeper is responsible for authenticating the client and deciding on what actions it is authorized to perform.</li><li><b>Resource allocation</b>: The gatekeeper accepts an abstract description of a resource to allocate and actualizes the resource request within the local environment.</li></ol><div>The existing software, Globus GRAM, provides a HTTP-like interface over TLS for remote access. &nbsp;The authentication is done using the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), using special client certificates. &nbsp;It does authorization by performing a callout to map the client certificate to a Unix account, then performing all further operations as that Unix user. &nbsp;The resource allocation provides an interface which accepts requests in Globus RSL (a job description language) and interact with a local batch system on the CE to run the job.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the HTCondor team, the OSG has been working to provide an alternate gatekeeper implementation, the <i style="font-weight: bold;">HTCondor-CE</i>. &nbsp;The HTCondor-CE is a special configuration of the HTCondor software which provides the three core pieces of functionality described above.</div><div><br /></div><div>HTCondor provides remote access using a custom communication protocol and called CEDAR. &nbsp;CEDAR provides a RPC and messaging mechanism over UDP or TCP, and can provide various levels of integrity or encryption based upon the session parameters. &nbsp;While the HTCondor-CE will ship with the same GSI authentication and authorization as Globus GRAM, it can be reconfigured to provide alternate authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos, SSL, shared secret, or even IP-based authentication.</div><div><br /></div><div>The HTCondor-CE allocates resources via having the client submit HTCondor jobs to a scheduler running on the CE (the schedd daemon). &nbsp;We refer to this as the "<i>grid job</i>". &nbsp;A separate daemon, the JobRouter, is responsible for transforming the <i>grid job</i>&nbsp;to a resource allocation for site. &nbsp;For a site with a HTCondor batch system, it will transform and mirror the <i>grid job</i>&nbsp;into the <i>routed job</i>&nbsp;in the site's batch system. &nbsp;The process is illustrated below:</div><div><br /></div><div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UbMFNUvwsVs/UQaP3f6n4jI/AAAAAAAACl4/OqW79vo6g4I/s1600/HTCondorCE_Condor.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IagX60Tm5WQ/UQaQd7aZNkI/AAAAAAAACmA/OKNIpiTEQ-4/s1600/CondorCE_PBS.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="292" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IagX60Tm5WQ/UQaQd7aZNkI/AAAAAAAACmA/OKNIpiTEQ-4/s320/CondorCE_PBS.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The HTCondor-CE submit workflow for a PBS site. &nbsp;Notice the blahp, not the JobRouter, does the submission to PBS in this case.</td></tr></tbody></table>The blahp daemon is a common piece of software for interacting with batch systems - in addition to being integrated in the HTCondor grid universe, it also is used by the BOSCO project and the CREAM CE.<br /><br />Note there is no requirement that the job be routed into a batch system - given the appropriate transform logic. the JobRouter could also transform the grid job into VM running in Amazon EC2, an OpenStack instance, or a job for another HTCondor-CE!<br /><br />The CE is quite flexible; it is a configuration of the HTCondor software and leverages all the features available in HTCondor. &nbsp;As another example, we benefit from the fact that HTCondor's security uses sessions; clients do not re-authenticate for each status update. &nbsp;Future features, such as the sandbox size limits in the upcoming 7.9.4, can be used immediately by the CE through a configuration file change.<br /><br />The HTCondor-CE is currently under development, although functionality has been demonstrated using glideinWMS for up to 5,000 running pilots. &nbsp;It requires HTCondor 7.9.2 or later, so we are waiting for the next stable release (due late April) before starting to release the CE more widely. &nbsp;As we near release, I am planning on doing additional updates on specific pieces of this technology.<br /><br />We're looking forward to see how users will put it into action!<br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>HTCondor supports a notion of aggregate compute resources known as partitionable slots (p-slots), which may be consumed by multiple jobs.   Historically, at most one job could be matched against such a slot in a single negotiation cycle, which limited the rate at which partitionable slot resources could be utilized.  More recently, the scheduler has been enhanced with logic to allow it to acquire multiple claims against a partitionable slot, which increases the p-slot utilization rate. However, as this potentially bypasses the negotiator's accounting of global pool resources such as accounting group quotas and concurrency limits, it places some contraints on what jobs can can safely acquire multiple claims against any particular p-slot: for example, only other jobs on the same scheduler can be considered.  Additionally, candidate job requirements must match the requirements of the job that originally matched in the negotiator.  Another significant impact is that the negotiator is still forced to match an entire p-slot, which may have a large match cost (weight): these large match costs cause <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">accounting difficulties</a> when submitter shares and/or group quotas drop below the cost of a slot.  This particular problem is growing steadily larger, as machines with ever-larger numbers of cores and other resources appear in HTCondor pools. [...]</p>
